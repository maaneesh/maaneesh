### Hello, I'm Manish 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in New York City. I enjoy building projects with JavaScript (which I believe is wildly misunderstood!), and I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through thoughtful engineering.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a full-stack food donation tracker app (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: TypeScript, AWS Lambda, and advanced Git workflows
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: open source projects that align with civic tech, fintech, or education
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: building scalable backend systems and writing better tests
- 💬 Ask me about: JavaScript, Spring Boot, system design, or tech career transitions
- 📫 How to reach me: 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once taught robotics to middle schoolers using LEGO Mindstorms!
